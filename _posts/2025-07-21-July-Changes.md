“Police beat us, then tell us to move — and then what? They fired from the back,” said one of the July activists. This phenomenon echoes the crossfire incidents involving gangsters. Were the protesters aligned with gangsters and criminals? What was their crime? Did they demand any form of change? Speaking of change, the main question arises: Was that movement able to change the political landscape at all?
<br><br>
On the 9th of July, 2025, a nefarious incident took place: a person was openly stoned to death, which highlights the country's current contumacious state, raising questions about the effectiveness of law enforcement agencies. The interim government seems too lenient in the face of injustice, atrocious acts, and violence. Reforms remain stalled amid meeting after meeting, making us less sanguine. Attacking opponents in broad daylight, whether due to personal enmity or ideological conflict, has become normalized. The government has failed to handle the current situation, leading to widespread anarchy across the country.
<br><br>
No, we have to be positive. Let's recall what changes we wanted after the 5th of August. A free and fair election was surely one of them, but not the only one. The very system that has enabled the rise of autocrats needs to be changed, because a July Uprising cannot be allowed to emerge again and again. We must seal that road by leveling the electoral playing field, including limiting the president to two terms, reducing the prime minister's power, and ensuring opposition parties are represented in key parliamentary committees, among other measures. All these reforms sound justified and can be found in the political systems of developed countries. Making major changes to our constitution to fix biased, ambiguous, and faulty clauses has been a central demand of students, along with various political parties.
<br><br>
The Solidarity Commission managed to make political parties agree on some issues, including a bicameral legislature, increasing reserved seats for women in parliament, and others. However, debate continues over how these changes will be implemented. Most of the issues that have been resolved are minor, leaving the major ones still in dispute. These disagreements give rise to another problem: whether the election should be held before the reforms or after. The largest party wants the election to be held immediately, arguing that reforms should be carried out by an elected government, not an interim one. Impartial citizens can see the risks of allowing that to happen. The current political structure of the country enables major parties to rise to power and equips them with the tools to become authoritarian. It would be a betrayal of the sacrifice made by over 1,000 July martyrs to leave Bangladesh unchanged and unreformed. The NCP, Jamaat, and other parties remain firm in their demand for reform, while the BNP wants an election as early as possible to restore the voting rights of the Bangladeshi people.
<br><br>
Our Chief Advisor has held meetings with every party to ensure that every voice is heard. But being an old and comparatively well-organized party, the BNP remains the key player. Their leaders continuously push for an election, while NCP leaders stress the necessity of reform for the sake of the July martyrs and the country’s welfare. If one group deliberately tries to obstruct the reform process, while the other tries to postpone the election, we will end up in a deadlock. Some may think this is a good idea, as it could allow the interim government to last longer. But that will not benefit our country, either economically or juridically. Without a permanent government, foreign investors will be reluctant to invest, and the chaos and ineffectiveness will continue.
<br><br>
We both want reform and elections. People want to regain their voting rights while ensuring it doesn't pave the way for another Hasina-style regime. We want peace, respect, and progress. As a third-world country, we already face many limitations and disadvantages. After being deprived of our basic rights for more than 15 years, it’s time for a fresh start, one that ensures people can vote for whoever they choose. To break the stereotype of voting only for traditional parties, new parties like the NCP must reach the masses with clear policies and development-focused plans. If avarice triumphs over the solidarity that once ousted a fascist regime, it will mark the ultimate failure for this nation. Changes that can't be made now will surely become impossible for at least the next 50 years, who knows?
