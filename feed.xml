They fired from the back,” said one of the July activists. This phenomenon echoes the crossfire incidents involving gangsters. Were the protesters aligned with gangsters and criminals? What was their crime? Did they demand any form of change? Speaking of change, the main question arises: Was that movement able to change the political landscape at all? <br/><br/> On the 9th of July, 2025, a nefarious incident took place: a person was openly stoned to death, which highlights the country’s current contumacious state, raising questions about the effectiveness of law enforcement agencies. The interim government seems too lenient in the face of injustice, atrocious acts, and violence. Reforms remain stalled amid meeting after meeting, making us less sanguine. Attacking opponents in broad daylight, whether due to personal enmity or ideological conflict, has become normalized. The government has failed to handle the current situation, leading to widespread anarchy across the country. <br/><br/> No, we have to be positive. Let’s recall what changes we wanted after the 5th of August. A free and fair election was surely one of them, but not the only one. The very system that has enabled the rise of autocrats needs to be changed, because a July Uprising cannot be allowed to emerge again and again. We must seal that road by leveling the electoral playing field, including limiting the president to two terms, reducing the prime minister’s power, and ensuring opposition parties are represented in key parliamentary committees, among other measures. All these reforms sound justified and can be found in the political systems of developed countries. Making major changes to our constitution to fix biased, ambiguous, and faulty clauses has been a central demand of students, along with various political parties. <br/><br/> The Solidarity Commission managed to make political parties agree on some issues, including a bicameral legislature, increasing reserved seats for women in parliament, and others. However, debate continues over how these changes will be implemented. Most of the issues that have been resolved are minor, leaving the major ones still in dispute. These disagreements give rise to another problem: whether the election should be held before the reforms or after. The largest party wants the election to be held immediately, arguing that reforms should be carried out by an elected government, not an interim one. Impartial citizens can see the risks of allowing that to happen. The current political structure of the country enables major parties to rise to power and equips them with the tools to become authoritarian. It would be a betrayal of the sacrifice made by over 1,000 July martyrs to leave Bangladesh unchanged and unreformed. The NCP, Jamaat, and other parties remain firm in their demand for reform, while the BNP wants an election as early as possible to restore the voting rights of the Bangladeshi people. <br/><br/> Our Chief Advisor has held meetings with every party to ensure that every voice is heard. But being an old and comparatively well-organized party, the BNP remains the key player. Their leaders continuously push for an election, while NCP leaders stress the necessity of reform for the sake of the July martyrs and the country’s welfare. If one group deliberately tries to obstruct the reform process, while the other tries to postpone the election, we will end up in a deadlock. Some may think this is a good idea, as it could allow the interim government to last longer. But that will not benefit our country, either economically or juridically. Without a permanent government, foreign investors will be reluctant to invest, and the chaos and ineffectiveness will continue. <br/><br/> We both want reform and elections. People want to regain their voting rights while ensuring it doesn’t pave the way for another Hasina-style regime. We want peace, respect, and progress. As a third-world country, we already face many limitations and disadvantages. After being deprived of our basic rights for more than 15 years, it’s time for a fresh start, one that ensures people can vote for whoever they choose. To break the stereotype of voting only for traditional parties, new parties like the NCP must reach the masses with clear policies and development-focused plans. If avarice triumphs over the solidarity that once ousted a fascist regime, it will mark the ultimate failure for this nation. Changes that can’t be made now will surely become impossible for at least the next 50 years, who knows?</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="politics"/><category term="national"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's check if post-July Bangladesh is on the right path!]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Does India Suck at Neighborhood Diplomacy?</title><link href="https://abdullahalnaeem.github.io/blog/2025/Indian-diplomacy/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Does India Suck at Neighborhood Diplomacy?"/><published>2025-07-20T02:26:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-07-20T02:26:00+00:00</updated><id>https://abdullahalnaeem.github.io/blog/2025/Indian-diplomacy</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://abdullahalnaeem.github.io/blog/2025/Indian-diplomacy/"><![CDATA[<p>Does India Suck at Neighborhood Diplomacy?</p> <p>ET2</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/india-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/india-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/india-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/india.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <br/> “You can change friends, but you cannot change neighbors.”<br/> — Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Former Prime Minister of India<br/> It's not a great time for Indian diplomacy. Maybe they are doing a decent job in Western countries, but the same cannot be said for its relations with neighboring nations. A country having direct land borders with six countries and maritime proximity with two others can be expected to have some regional allies. Sadly, that’s not the case. Most of them openly consider India less a benevolent partner and more a threat to their sovereignty, while others are maintaining only superficial relations with it. So, what has gone wrong that former allies have turned into formidable opponents? <br/><br/> When the BJP came to power in 2014, it prioritized the theme of “Neighborhood First Policy,” making efforts to reactivate SAARC, uphold bilateral relations, and pledge not to meddle in neighbors’ domestic affairs. But that didn’t continue for long, as gradually its neighbors began to turn their backs on the most powerful nation of South Asia. Indian media, fragile duplicity led diplomacy, all contributed to this issue. Whether through economic leverage, strategic infrastructure, or subtle, subterranean displays of military presence, India has often appeared more hegemonic than harmonious toward its neighbors. We can start with Bangladesh, the friendliest country to India for more than a decade, where, after August 5th, 2024, relations changed significantly. Anti-India sentiment peaked at an all-time high due to India’s dominance over Bangladesh in the previous regime, which was ousted by a student-led movement last year. Bangladeshis believe that from river water sharing to indiscriminate killings along the India-Bangladesh border, India behaved unfairly. The trade deficit between these two countries stands at a staggering $8.6 billion, underscoring the paucity of exports flowing into India from its neighbor. By granting shelter to former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, India cemented the perception that it interferes in Bangladesh's internal affairs. This singular act continues to reverberate in the country’s political discourse. <br/><br/> Sri Lanka, currently led by a pro-China administration, relies more on China than on India. The relationship between Sri Lanka and India has faced many vicissitudes. Allegedly supporting Tamil Tiger rebel groups, deploying troops in their territory, and deprecating Lankan fishermen by restricting access to their own maritime zones all led to internal disputes between the nations. Though Sri Lanka is receiving loans from India, that hasn’t been enough to change the political landscape as a whole. Relying on China, in such close proximity to India, poses a serious strategic threat. The dominating posture assumed by Indian diplomacy deeply upset the Lankans, resulting in a complicated relationship. “India Out” was the slogan of the party currently running the Maldives. Removing India’s military presence was the center of Mohamed Muizzu’s campaign. A huge backlash was seen in India too, from cutting relationships to cancelling trips to the Maldives by Indian tourists. Leaning toward China seemed inevitable at that time. This 2023 incident sent a clear message to the world: India’s dominance is being actively opposed by its neighbors, fueling anti-India sentiment across Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Though Prime Minister Modi is now trying to mend the relationship by striking deals with the current Maldivian government, the damage has already been done. <br/><br/> Nepal, the only Hindu-majority country in the world, might be expected to be India’s closest ally, but reality paints a different picture. The previous monarchy in Nepal, backed by India, was overthrown by popular movement, symbolizing a bold defiance of Indian dominance. Tensions have simmered ever since, fueled by long-standing territorial disputes. The situation worsened when Nepal’s current government unveiled a revised map that claimed a stretch of land also claimed by India, further straining their already fragile relationship. <br/><br/> The relationship between India and Pakistan is historically belligerent. A recent near-war situation left both sides with casualties. India claims Pakistan backs local militias in Jammu and Kashmir, creating turbulence in the region. Meanwhile, Pakistan has often accused India of being a “water terrorist,” alleging that New Delhi deliberately restricts river flows that sustain nearly 80% of Pakistan’s agrarian economy as well as its industrial sector. With China being a key ally of Pakistan, the dynamic becomes even more complicated. These two nuclear-armed nations have become a persistent security threat to the entire subcontinent, with their implacable rivalry fueling instability across South Asia. In this case, a hostile relationship may seem understandable. <br/><br/> Now, the ultimate threat to India, China, has become its biggest rival both economically and militarily. In addition, China’s increasingly successful foreign policy has ensured that most of India’s neighbors are now leaning more toward Beijing than toward New Delhi. In ongoing border disputes, China appears to be a key player, and their rivalry is likely to continue, shaping the balance of power in the region. <br/><br/> India could have been more sensible in managing its relationships with its neighbors, but instead, it miscalculated and misjudged. By abandoning dominating attitudes, responding to real needs, building joint projects, and balancing trade deficits, India still has the chance to fix its diplomacy before it's too late. A balanced and constructive relationship between India and its neighbors is essential for the welfare of the subcontinent. Without it, persistent tensions will continue to impede progress and risk relegating the whole of South Asia to stagnation. </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="geopolitics"/><category term="international"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's talk about Indian neighborhood diplomacy]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Zohran Mamdani being the Next Mayor of the World’s Capital?</title><link href="https://abdullahalnaeem.github.io/blog/2025/Mamdani/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Zohran Mamdani being the Next Mayor of the World’s Capital?"/><published>2025-07-19T11:46:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-07-19T11:46:00+00:00</updated><id>https://abdullahalnaeem.github.io/blog/2025/Mamdani</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://abdullahalnaeem.github.io/blog/2025/Mamdani/"><![CDATA[<p>Zohran Mamdani being the Next Mayor of the World’s Capital?</p> <p>ET1</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/mamdani-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/mamdani-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/mamdani-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/mamdani.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <br/> As a proverb goes, “Spring doesn’t ask winter for permission to arrive.” The mayoral election of NYC usually isn’t a vogue topic in global politics. But this time, it feels prodigious. From the USA to India, a new face is bringing hope to many or serving as a harbinger of disruption to others. Zohran Mamdani, born in Uganda with an Indian family heritage, has become a new sensation in world politics. While the President of the USA has started to taunt him by branding him a “communist lunatic,” a huge portion of NYC considers Mamdani their panacea. With such a formidable opponent, can he truly advance, or is it just ephemeral hype? <br/> <br/> June 24th was a pivotal day for Mamdani. He became the first Democratic nominee for NYC mayor, defeating former Governor Andrew Cuomo by almost 12% under the Ranked-Choice Voting (RCV) system. At the beginning of the year, he had a meager 1% popularity. So what happened over this short time that made him the favorite? <br/> <br/> We now live in a digitally saturated milieu. Conventional campaigning is becoming obsolete and ineffectual. This shift benefited Mamdani. His engaging and vibrant personality made him a star in the online world. With only an $8 million campaign budget, Mamdani beat Cuomo, who had $24 million. This created a stunning upset in New York politics. Zohran amassed most of his funds from public contributions. His bold, some would say whimsical, proposals for NYC’s working-class population gained both adulation and umbrage. He has become a symbol of progressive ideals. But the opposition did not remain dormant. Critics paint Mamdani as inexperienced, perfidious, even anti-Semitic. Partial media outlets have amplified these accusations. <br/> <br/> It’s mostly older people who go out to vote, often reinforcing leaders with outdated mindsets and corrupt systems. Mamdani disrupted this status quo. He galvanized younger voters, whose turnout proved pivotal. NYC is a city of immigrants, with 60% of its residents foreign-born. Mamdani canvassed among Hispanic, Bengali, Muslim, and Indian communities, engaging in conjugal connections with the people and going door to door. Around 60,000 volunteers rallied behind him, forming a veritable grassroots force. Progressives support Zohran. His outspoken criticism of Netanyahu’s regime has resonated with many Muslims. People from other ethnic groups really connect with his background. The queer community also supports him for being vocally on their side. <br/> <br/> Among his key proposals are:<br/> 1. Free public transportation<br/> 2. Free healthcare<br/> 3. Rent freeze<br/> 4. City-run grocery stores<br/> 5. Diversifying the NYPD <br/> <br/> He claims these initiatives will be funded by taxing billionaires. His message, “Billionaires already have everything. Now, your time has come,” attracted many. Why wouldn’t it? The cost of rent is outrageously unaffordable now. The majority of New Yorkers are working not to afford luxuries, but merely to survive. Mamdani pledges not to foist hardship on the poor but to alleviate their plight by promoting equitable reform. But his road is fraught with vicissitudes. Critics argue that his policies are chimerical, more theoretical than feasible. They also warn that his leadership might cause billionaires and corporations to decamp, leading to economic attrition. In a country steeped in capitalism, the idea of a democratic socialist running its biggest city feels radical, especially to those who still confuse socialism with extremism. <br/> <br/> The Jewish community plays a paramount role in NYC politics, and their dissent could be consequential. Accusations of anti-Semitism, largely stemming from Mamdani’s critique of Israeli policy, are already gaining traction. Despite his efforts to rebut these claims and clarify his stance, skepticism remains. Mayor Eric Adams, staunchly pro-Israel, dismisses Mamdani’s agenda as untenable. <br/> <br/> Mamdani has also drawn fire from Donald Trump, who labeled him his “worst nightmare.” The combined force of Republicans and conservative Democrats poses a formidable challenge. Mamdani and his supporters appear undaunted. Notably, he has been endorsed by Bernie Sanders, a Jewish senator. This endorsement helps debunk the calumny of religious animosity. <br/> <br/> The January 2026 election looms. If Mamdani continues his zealous campaign, grounds it in viable strategies, and maintains strong connections with NYC’s diverse and youthful electorate, he may remain the front-runner. Cuomo and Adams, both Democrats, will split votes, and a Republican candidate will also run. Given that New York is a Democrat-dominated city, the real battle may occur within the left. If conservative voters and certain Jewish blocs coalesce against Mamdani, the race could become tight. Perhaps it is prudent for him to temper his rhetoric against billionaires and avoid being labeled a 'communist'. However, if he can convince voters of his intentions and articulate a lucid, pragmatic roadmap, he might become the next great political icon, redefining the American narrative. <br/> <br/> He must do all this while remaining steadfast in his advocacy for justice, especially in confronting the oppression of Gazans by the Israeli state. </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="politics"/><category term="international"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ongoing mayoral election campaigining in NYC.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">a post with code diff</title><link href="https://abdullahalnaeem.github.io/blog/2024/code-diff/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="a post with code diff"/><published>2024-01-27T19:22:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-01-27T19:22:00+00:00</updated><id>https://abdullahalnaeem.github.io/blog/2024/code-diff</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://abdullahalnaeem.github.io/blog/2024/code-diff/"><![CDATA[<p>You can display diff code by using the regular markdown syntax:</p> <div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">```</span><span class="nl">diff
